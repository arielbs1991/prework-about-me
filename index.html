      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am beginning my journey into the world of tech and am thrilled to be learning these new skills.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Seattle, Washington, and never made it too far away.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to cook - put me on Chopped and see what I can do with mystery leftovers. I can bake the best loaf of bread you've ever had. My husband and I like to play Magic the Gathering. I also garden and spend time with our three dogs.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Raising hogs, goats, bees and chickens on a little plot of land with fruit trees, selling handmade cheese and yogurt, honey, and homebrewed wine and mead. In the meantime, something that allows me to solve puzzles and support my family.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in South Seattle near the airport with my husband, my brother, our three dogs and three cats.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have been working in the service sector for some time now, and I miss exercising the logic and creativity parts of my brain. I've been looking for a way to work remotely and be able to support my family, and the precision of web development appeals to me.</p>
